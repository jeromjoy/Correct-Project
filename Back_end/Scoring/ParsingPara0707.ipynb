      "['This report from\\xa0OilPrice.com\\xa0is a paid advertorial', '', 'Make no mistake: Your data is under attack and hacker extortionists are getting rich—but this is a war with opportunities on both sides, and for the warriors fighting cybercrime, it’s a $200-billion-plus opportunity with endless market potential.', 'When your email can be hacked by a 12-year-old, and giant Internet of Things (IoT) companies like Yahoo!, Google and Facebook can’t keep you safe, the e-mail of the future promises to halt data theft in its tracks.', 'And one little-known company is doing just that …', 'California-based Identillect Technologies Corp. (TSX-V:ID; OTCQB: IDTLF) is storming the data security space with a historical first: an email encryption solution that is cheap and easy to use—for everyone.', 'In fact, it’s a brilliant 2-minute email install solution that has the potential to win the lion’s share of the profits in an industry where security is now the Holy Grail.', 'Identillect is ready to storm this war zone with the first solution that fights back against hackers with the push of a button, and their solution can be used as a plugin on Gmail, Outlook, Office 365, Hotmail, and on mobile-optimized web portals.', 'With Identillect now approaching 40,000 subscribers and enjoying amazing 70 percent margins, low churn and phenomenal subscriber growth, this 10-cents-a-share company could be the fastest path to outsized gains for first-in investors.', '\\xa0Here are 6 reasons why you should keep an eye on Identillect Corp (TSX-V:ID; OTCQB: IDTLF).:', '1) CyberSecurity is the Hottest Sector Right Now', 'Not only can your email be hacked by a pre-teen, but giant companies are paying out massive money to hackers directly or indirectly …', 'Corporate panic now rules the day, and it’s all about cyber security. Eager investors pumped $3.5 billion into 400-plus cybersecurity startups in 2016 alone. This market is expected to reach $170 billion by 2020, according to the Steven Morgan Cybersecurity Industry Outlook. That’s a 4,750 percent increase.', 'Securing email is a big part of that, and the first to crack it will see their stocks rise exponentially.', '2) As Easy as a Plug-In', 'Identillect Corp (TSX-V:ID; OTCQB: IDTLF) offers Delivery Trust, a plugin that works unlike any standard email encryption tool out there.', 'Until now, no one outside of spies has been encrypting their email. Why? It’s complicated and cumbersome—and expensive. You just hit send or submit and hope for the best, crossing your fingers that your social security number or credit card information isn’t going to end up in the wrong person’s hands.', 'Encryption hasn’t been a very attractive option. It usually requires you to download software to do it, and then you hit problems on the other end: The recipient also has to have the software in order to decrypt, otherwise there’s no point. Additionally, you have to be a member of a specific system to which you are locked into, and it costs a lot to switch vendors once you sign up.', 'Given the number of emails the average person goes through a day, this is a cumbersome process, even when it is possible.', 'So this is where encryption becomes easy: There’s no lock-in with Identillect’s Delivery Trust: You can access your email in three seconds flat.', 'Your emails are secured instantly with the click of a button ensuring 100 percent safety while in transit.', 'It’s a completely unobtrusive system: your email recipients can open and respond to your emails securely without having to register, purchase or download anything.', 'It comes with many more security features, including the phenomenal ability to retract an email that was erroneously sent, without a trace, even if the email has been opened, and even if it happened two years ago.', 'The plug-in is built around a patented technology that fully complies with all National and International data handling regulations. And it’s a white-label business model. That means it works equally well in Outlook Plugin, O365, Outlook.com, Hotmail.com, Gmail Plugin…It’s also available as a mobile app that works on iPhone, Android, Windows and other mobile operating systems.', 'Not only is Identillect’s email of the future elegantly simple—it’s also an amazingly low-cost solution to a high-cost problem. Nothing speaks to market share like that.', '3) 880% Subscriber Growth, 70% Profit Margins', 'Identillect Corp. has been enjoying explosive subscriber growth–the company’s customer base has increased 880 percent since commercialization in April 2015. That’s a nearly nine-fold increase in little over two years.', 'The company is firmly on the path to profitability, and expects to hit breakeven point once its subscriber base reaches 35,000 sometime during the fourth quarter of 2017.', '', 'The company has been able to achieve this phenomenal growth by creating a vast network of resellers across the globe.', 'The beauty of it all is that the company operates a highly lucrative SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) recurring revenue model, meaning its revenue and profits grow in tandem with its customer base.', 'Churn has consistently remained below 5 percent, a clear sign that customers are happy with the product.', 'Overall profit margins are now approaching 70 percent, which demonstrates the company’s pricing power and leadership in its niche category.', '4) Government-Mandated Market', 'Cyber insurance—one of the most lucrative business out there today—is no longer a luxury. It’s federally mandated.', 'Bloomberg estimates that the cost of a single breach now exceeds $7 million.', '', '', 'Source: Fortune.com', 'And if you don’t have protection, not only will the hackers get you—the governments fines will, too. Companies in Europe risk being fined as much as 4 percent of total annual revenue for breaches. But the U.S., Canada and Asia are not far behind this. In the U.S., 47 states have already enacted laws that require companies to notify the authorities in the event of any data breaches. Federal laws are expected to be passed during the current year.', '5) Top-Notch Cryptographers', 'The company that produces the email of the future will be the one with the best cryptographers. Even better, cryptographers with industry experience.', 'More than any other industry, cyber security isn’t going to take off without massive and very specific expertise.', 'That’s where Indentillect (TSX-V:ID; OTCQB: IDTLF) stands out.', 'There are only 250 Ph.D cryptographers in all of North America, and two of them are on the staff of Indentillect. That means that the company is one of the few lucky cybersecurity companies to get their hands on the best cryptographers.', 'Identillect CTO Einar Mykletun is one of them. He holds a Ph.D. in computer science with a focus on applied cryptography. He is the company’s security expert specializing in risk analysis and cryptographic solutions.', 'Company chairman Jeff Durno has served as director in several TSX-V-listed tech companies while CEO Todd Sexton is a data security and regulatory compliance expert who played a central role in the development of the company’s flagship product, Delivery Trust.', '6) The Most Critical Moment of the Digital Age', 'Never has privacy been a more critical issue. Nothing is sacred. Nothing is safe from prying eyes and theft. The digital age is a boon for thievery, and it’s about to get worse.', 'Congress recently handed Donald Trump critical legislation that paves the way to repeal and replace the privacy protection laws that have protected Internet users for a long time.', 'Internet providers such as Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), AT&T(NYSE:T) and Verizon will now have carte blanche to collect your web browsing and app usage data and sell it to third-parties if they so wish.', 'And it underscores why the necessity of vigorously safeguarding our private data more than ever before.', 'Companies everywhere have started scrambling for the best-possible email security tools as the new laws come into force. But this is a crowded space right now, and only the best companies with the best products will survive. That means actual cryptographers who can come up with a solution that is fast, easy to use and affordable.', 'That is Identillect, (TSX-V:ID; OTCQB: IDTLF).', 'Identillect Corp. is currently on an exponential growth phase. Its subscriber base continues expanding quickly. As the company continues to expand its footprint, it’s beginning to target bigger customers which means even more growth ahead.', 'This is a fast-moving market that isn’t going to wait for anyone. Just two years ago the penetration of email security products in the market was a mere 2.5 percent–now its approaching 10 percent, and the sky is the limit in this hyper-growth sector.', 'You can expect the company to increasingly forge partnerships with the big boys in the space as it works to deliver the best possible products for its customers all over the globe.', 'But in the meantime, this company remains attractively undervalued, even though it’s a ripe takeover target right in the middle of a cybersecurity explosion.', 'By.

      "['', 'A big island coffee farmer who was able to rally the Kona community has lost his battle with immigration authorities. \\xa0The man has now said his final goodbyes to his family and had voluntarily deported himself back to Mexico.', 'Andres Magana Ortiz, who is 43-years-old, called Hawaii home for 30 years. \\xa0Hawaii’s Star Advertiser\\xa0has said that Ortiz has come to symbolize some of the shortcomings of immigration law under presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.\\xa0', 'Ortiz\\xa0is a coffee farmer, and really a hero to all of the morning challenged Americans out there. \\xa0But that didn’t stop the deportation back to his native land of Mexico.\\xa0“We said our goodbyes at home,” said Magana Ortiz’s \\xa020-year-old daughter Victoria Magana Ledesma. “My dad decided it was better for my brother and my sister to not go all the way to the airport,” she continued. \\xa0Magana Ortiz is a father of three and married (his wife and children are all US citizens), but because he was illegally living in Hawaii, he voluntarily paid for his own deportation, trying to make this situation easier on his American family.', 'On Friday night,\\xa0Magana Ortiz boarded flights he paid for to San Francisco, Houston, and finally, Morelia, Mexico, where he was ordered to return leaving the family and coffee farming business all behind. \\xa0Anti-immigration pundits will say that he broke the law and deserves this outcome, but not all agree. \\xa0Magana Ortiz was a productive\\xa0and tax-paying member of society, and he was not a criminal. But, as a boy, Magana Ortiz crossed the border from Mexico in 1989 without begging permission\\xa0and that’s criminal enough for some.', 'Magana Ortiz eventually made his way to Hawaii as a migrant worker to pick coffee. He has been successful in the United States and became one of the most respected farmers in the Kona district, leasing about 20 acres and helping run 15 other small farms. \\xa0Magana Ortiz was also a leader in efforts to control the coffee berry borer, a destructive pest discovered on Hawaii island back in 2010. He even collaborated with the U.S. Department of Agriculture on field tests.', '“I love this country and I love these islands. If I have to leave, it’s going to be very hard on everyone,” Magana Ortiz said before being ordered to return to Mexico.', 'The Obama administration started removal proceedings against Magana Ortiz in 2011 but granted him a temporary stay in 2014. In March, he was ordered to leave as the Trump administration stepped up enforcement against people in the country illegally.', 'Last month, Magana Ortiz\\xa0was granted a 30-day reprieve\\xa0on the deportation order that finally\\xa0came due. \\xa0A federal judge, Stephen Reinhardt of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, wrote in a May 30 opinion that while President Donald Trump has said he wants to target “bad hombres” in immigration enforcement, “the government’s decision to remove Magana Ortiz shows that even the ‘good hombres’ are not safe.”', 'Unfortunately, Magana Ortiz and his family are all suffering because of the “bad hombres” the laws are written for. \\xa0This is just further evidence that good people don’t need laws to tell them how to act and to be successful, and the bad\\xa0ones will always get around the laws to hurt others anyway. \\xa0', 'Magana Ortiz is one of the good ones, providing a service to people everywhere through his coffee farm. \\xa0He wasn’t one of the criminals who was putting other lives in danger, yet Obama started proceedings, and Trump finished it. It’s hard to say how long Magana Ortiz will be in Mexico, but his family is fighting to get him back.', '\\xa0\\n', 'Delivered by The Daily Sheeple', 'We encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos (Click for details).

      "['', 'Nevada residents and tourists hoping to partake in some of the state’s newly legalized recreational cannabis might be out of luck — dispensaries have been running low on supply after crushing business during the first week of legal sales.', '“The line is out the door and the line just doesn’t stop,” opined Al Fasano of ReLeaf, a medical dispensary in Las Vegas, to CNN Money, shortly after Nevada gave the green light for green. “People are there when we open [at 10 a.m.] and they’re there when we close [at midnight].”', 'At issue — and unsurprisingly, given the notorious inefficiencies of government — are regulations governing the transport of weed from cultivators to stores, as only the state’s alcohol distributors have permission to ship the plant.', 'But none have yet procured licensing from Nevada to do so.', '“I think they’d like to do it; they’re just not ready,” remarked Andrew Jolley, CEO of The Source, a company with dispensaries in Las Vegas and Henderson. “We hope we have sufficient supply to last a few days or weeks until the distributors are able to come online to supply us.”', 'CNN Money reported, “State regulators decided that the transportation of recreational marijuana should fall exclusively to liquor distributors for the first 18 months of legal sales.', '“But when the state reached out to the liquor distributors about the new enterprise, only a few replied, and they said they didn’t want to do it, according to the Nevada Department of Taxation.', 'When liquor distributors balked at the opportunity, the state loosened weed transportation strictures so others could apply — but the Independent Alcohol Distributors of Nevada scoffed, sued, and won exclusivity on transport, via a ruling by a judge in Carson City.', 'However, the liquor industry still hasn’t capitalized on its golden egg-laying hen.', 'Nevada, nonetheless, is reaping the lucrative benefits of legal weed — between last Saturday and Tuesday, the state profited an estimated $1 million from taxation of the product, with dispensaries pulling in around $3 million.', 'To stave off an inevitable supply void, Nevada has temporarily allowed medical dispensaries to re-categorize some medical product as recreational — and then restock the shelves with additional medicinal product.', '“It is important to emphasize that nothing in the order prohibits the marijuana industry from starting — the state can simply license the alcohol distributors and let them get to work,” attorney Kevin Benson, with the alcohol distribution industry, told CNN Money. “That is, of course, what we would like to see happen.”', 'Prior to legalization for recreational use, Nevadans could only purchase cannabis legally for medical use — but long lines and a constant flow of traffic indicate the plant’s intense popularity for reasons other than treating cancers, PTSD, prescription and illicit opioid abuse, and more.', 'ReLeaf, alone, experienced an astronomical uptick in sales during the first weekend of recreational sales, with upwards of 1,000 customers each day — compared to between 100 and 150, who had purchased cannabis for medical reasons prior to the new law.', 'Kinks should be expected in the nascent stages of the implementation of any new legislation, but the categorical popularity of recreational weed — as evinced in Colorado, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska, the only other states where recreational use is legal — apparently did not prepare regulators holding red tape for this veritable run on the market.', '“The business owners in this industry have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build facilities across the state,” asserted Nevada Department of Taxation spokeswoman, Stephanie Klapstein, in an email to USA Today. “They have hired and trained thousands of additional employees to meet the demands of the market. Unless the issue with distributor licensing is resolved quickly, the inability to deliver product to retail stores will result in many of these people losing their jobs and will bring this nascent market to a grinding halt. A halt in this market will lead to a hole in the state’s school budget.”', 'As government is wont, everything is tied to everything else; and, that legal weed is tied to education could be quite the roadblock, if Nevada fails to expedite solutions to its rapidly dwindling supply.', '“Revenue collected from the 15% cultivation tax goes toward schools, while the 10% sales tax revenue goes toward the state’s rainy day fund, which can be used for any number of expenditures,” USA Today reports.', 'While it may go without saying for many of us ambivalent toward anything State controlled, perhaps Nevada — and its massive tourism industry now including pot vacationers — would be wiser to backtrack on untenable restrictions surrounding the sale of legal weed.\\n', 'Delivered by The Daily Sheeple', 'We encourage you to share and republish our reports, analyses, breaking news and videos (Click for details).
